Study projects for HTW Berlin (Business Computing)

This repository contains some projects, that I implemented during my study in at the University of Applied Sciences Berlin (in German: Hochschule f√ºr Technik und Wirtschaft Berlin - HTW Berlin) since October 2017. My study program is Business Computing (Wirtschaftsinformatik).

Projects are organised into folders by subject and semester.

The code is a funny mix of German and English languages, because I study in German University and they tend (and force us) to use German forvariable names, functions, etc. but as all general concepts in IT are in English, many English words are used as well. However this only relates to studies, and my approach to the coding is to use english-only names and descriptions, which I intend to follow outside of my studies.
